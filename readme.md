# Your Project Name

## Introduction
Welcome to simple programming language, a unique programming environment inspired by a fun game I played with my friends, where we pretended some of us were robots being controlled. This project translates that concept into a programming language with exciting functions, offering an interactive way to learn programming through games.

## Features
- **Sprite Control**: Manipulate sprites with functions like `FastForward();`.
- **Interactive Environment**: The environment simulates a game where sprites interact based on user-defined code.
- **Custom Programming Language**: Designed for intuitive and fun programming experiences.
- **Web-Based IDE**: Everything runs in your browser, making it accessible and easy to start.
